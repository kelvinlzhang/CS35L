Lab 0 

1. By using man man, we can see that man -k [search_term] will return a list
of commands that contain [search_term] in their descriptions.

2. The which command shows the full path of executables.
    $ which wc
    /usr/bin/wc
    $ which cp
    /usr/bin/cp

3. In order to find executables with names consisting of a single character we
use the find command to search names using the ? token. ? represents a single
unknown character.

    $ find /usr/bin -name ?
    /usr/bin/[
    /usr/bin/w
    /usr/bin/X

    w shows who is currently logged on and what they are doing.
    X is a network-transparent window management system.
    Cannot manually execute [.

4. By using readlink we can print out the value of a symbolic link.

    $ readlink /usr/bin/emacs
    /etc/alternatives/emacs

5. According to the chmod man page, g+s makes it so that when the file is
executed, it will be run under the permissions of that user's group and not
the user. o-x removes others' execution permission.

6. Again referencing the man pages, the command we want is

    $ find [path] -mtime -21

-mtime indicates that we want to search by time modified while -21 means less
than 21 days, or 3 weeks.

7. Searching in my user account's home directory and using -type d to specify
directories:

    $ find . -type d -mtime -21
    .
    ./CS33
    ./CS35L
    ./CS35L/lab0
    ./CS35L/solutions

8. First we need to locate the directory the find file is in.

    $ which find
    /usr/bin/find

Then we use find in this directory, specifying the type l for links.

    $ find /usr/bin -type l

This will list out all of the links, which we count to a total 241.

9. To do this we can use:

    $ ls /usr/lib -tl

-t sorts the list from newest to oldest while -l prints the list in long list
format. Then the lowest entry in the list with the first character - is the
oldest regular file, or in our case, libfreeblpriv3.so which was modified on
Aug 7, 2015.

10. According the man pages for the locale command it gets its data from
current environment variables.

11. Using the apropos option of help C-h a sort

Buffer-menu-sort              M-x ... RET
  Command: Sort the buffer menu by COLUMN.
Buffer-menu-sort-by-column    M-x ... RET
  Command: Sort the buffer menu by the column clicked on.
ibuffer-invert-sorting        M-x ... RET
  Command: Toggle whether or not sorting is in reverse order.
ibuffer-toggle-sorting-mode   M-x ... RET
  Command: Toggle the current sorting mode.
rmail-sort-by-author          M-x ... RET
  Command: Sort messages of current Rmail file by author.
rmail-sort-by-correspondent   M-x ... RET
  Command: Sort messages of current Rmail file by other correspondent.
rmail-sort-by-date            M-x ... RET
  Command: Sort messages of current Rmail file by date.
rmail-sort-by-labels          M-x ... RET
  Command: Sort messages of current Rmail file by labels.
rmail-sort-by-lines           M-x ... RET
  Command: Sort messages of current Rmail file by number of lines.
rmail-sort-by-recipient       M-x ... RET
  Command: Sort messages of current Rmail file by recipient.

12. Using C-h k to describe each key sequence:

C-M-a
Move backward to the beginning of a defun.

C-M-b
Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).

C-M-c
Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.

C-M-d
Move forward down one level of parentheses.

C-M-e
Move forward to next end of defun.

C-M-f
Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).

C-M-g
Does not exist

C-M-h
Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.
The defun marked is the one that contains point or follows point.

13. C-g will cancel the current command.

14. yank will paste the last thing killed to the buffer.

15. emacs displays 2 more directories "." and ".." and appears to count many
more files than ls.
