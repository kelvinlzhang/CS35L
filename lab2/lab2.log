1. Set locale variables
$ export LC_ALL = 'C'

2. Check locale variable values
$ locale

3. Sort words in /usr/share/dict/words and put into words.txt in working dir
$ sort /usr/share/dict/words > words.txt

4. Download assignment webpage html
$ wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring16/cs35L/assign/assign2.html

5. Run commands described on assignment page on assign2.html using the syntax
$ tr (command) < assign2.html | (consecutive command)

tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
Replaces non-letter characters with the newline character.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
Same as previous command except consecutive non-letter characters are replaced
with a single newline.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
Takes output of previous command and sorts it in ascending ASCII order

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
Same as previous command except only unique sequences of letters are retained

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
Compares unique sorted output to words file, prints three columns: first column
with words unique to assign2.html, 2nd with words unique to words and 3rd with
words shared by both files.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words
Same as previous command except only the first column is displayed.

6. Create local copy of the English to Hawaiian website
$ wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.htm

7. Write shell script

grep -E '<td>.+</td>'
Grabs both English and Hawaiian words including the HTML tags

sed '1~2d'
Deletes the lines with English words

sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'
Deletes HTML tags

tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'
Makes all characters lowercase

sed 's/`/'\''/g'
Replace ` with '

tr -s ',*[:space:]+' '[\n*]'
Replace consecutive spaces and possible preceding comma with a single newline

grep"['AaEeIiOoUuHhLlWwNnMmKkPp]"
Discard any words with non-Hawaiian letters

sort -u
Sort in ASCII order and discard duplicates

Piping these commands into each other gives us the resulting shell script

#!/bin/bash
grep -E '<td>.+</td>' | sed '1~2d' | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | tr '[:upper:]'
'[:lower:]' | sed 's/`/'\''/g' | tr -s ',*[:space:]*' '[\n*]' | grep -v
"[^'AaEeIiOoUuHhLlWwNnMmKkPp]" | sort -u

8. Execute shell script to create hwords
$ ./buildwords < hwnwdseng.htm > hwords

9. Modify last given command to spell check using Hawaiian dictionary
$ cat assign2.html | tr -cs 'A-Za-z`' '[\n*]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc

406 misspelled Hawaiian words found
