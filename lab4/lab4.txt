1. Copy the diffutils folder from ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2. cd into diffutils and then use
$ git log > git-log.txt

3. $ git tag > git-tag.txt

4. I used grep to search git-log.txt for the commit and copied its hash number,
then used
$ git show [hashnumber] > quote-patch.txt

5. $ git checkout v3.0

6. $ patch -p0 quote-patch.txt

7. git status shows tracked and untracked files

8, 9. I used emacs revert C-x v u to revert all of the changes in non .c files
and then used the diff command C-x v = to find changes in the .c files and
manually change the ones that effected the comments.

10. I found 2 files diff.c.rej and diff3.c.rej that contained changed that
needed to be manually applied in their corresponding .c file.

11. git clean -f to remove untracked files

12. git status yields

#   modified:   src/cmp.c
#   modified:   src/diff.c
#   modified:   src/diff3.c
#   modified:   src/dir.c
#   modified:   src/sdiff.c
#   modified:   src/util.c

Put this modified patch into a file:
$ git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt

13. To build the resulting modified version
$ ./bootstrap

Applied the gets.diff patch
$ patch -p0 < gets.diff

$ ./configure
$ make

To check for right quote mark:
$ ./src/diff . -
$ ./src/diff --help

14. To use our newly built diff to check our work I grabbed another copy of
the original 3.0 code and my modified code, and used cp to copy their src
folders into diff-utils-3.0 and diff-utils respectively. Then I ran:

$  diffutils-patch/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch
> quote-3.0-test.txt

15. To compare I ran
$ diff quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt

There aren't any fundamental differences between the two, only change is the
use of backticks instead of quotation marks.
